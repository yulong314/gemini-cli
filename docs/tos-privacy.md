# Gemini CLI: Terms of Service and Privacy Notice

Gemini CLI is an open-source tool that lets you interact with Google's powerful language models directly from your command-line interface. The Terms of Service and Privacy Notices that apply to your usage of the Gemini CLI depend on the type of account you use to authenticate with Google.

This article outlines the specific terms and privacy policies applicable for different account types and authentication methods. Note: See [quotas and pricing](./quota-and-pricing.md) for the quota and pricing details that apply to your usage of the Gemini CLI.

## How to determine your authentication method

Your authentication method refers to the method you use to log into and access the Gemini CLI. There are four ways to authenticate:

- Logging in with your Google account to Gemini Code Assist for Individuals
- Logging in with your Google account to Gemini Code Assist for Workspace, Standard, or Enterprise Users
- Using an API key with Gemini Developer
- Using an API key with Vertex AI GenAI API

For each of these four methods of authentication, different Terms of Service and Privacy Notices may apply.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for the Gemini CLI

### 1. Is my code, including prompts and answers, used to train Google's models?

Whether your code, including prompts and answers, is used to train Google's models depends on the type of authentication method you use and your account type.

- **Google account with Gemini Code Assist for Individuals**: Yes. When you use your personal Google account, the [Gemini Code Assist Privacy Notice for Individuals](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/resources/privacy-notice-gemini-code-assist-individuals) applies. Under this notice,
  your **prompts, answers, and related code are collected** and may be used to improve Google's products, including for model training.
- **Google account with Gemini Code Assist for Workspace, Standard, or Enterprise**: No. For these accounts, your data is governed by the [Gemini Code Assist Privacy Notices](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/security-privacy-compliance#standard_and_enterprise_data_protection_and_privacy) terms, which treat your inputs as confidential. Your **prompts, answers, and related code are not collected** and are not used to train models.
- **Gemini API key via the Gemini Developer API**: Whether your code is collected or used depends on whether you are using an unpaid or paid service.
  - **Unpaid services**: Yes. When you use the Gemini API key via the Gemini Developer API with an unpaid service, the [Gemini API Terms of Service - Unpaid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services) terms apply. Under this notice, your **prompts, answers, and related code are collected** and may be used to improve Google's products, including for model training.

### 2. What are Usage Statistics and what does the opt-out control?

The **Usage Statistics** setting is the single control for all optional data collection in the Gemini CLI.

The data it collects depends on your account and authentication type:

- **Google account with Gemini Code Assist for Individuals**: When enabled, this setting allows Google to collect both anonymous telemetry (for example, commands run and performance metrics) and **your prompts and answers** for model improvement.
- **Google account with Gemini Code Assist for Workspace, Standard, or Enterprise**: This setting only controls the collection of anonymous telemetry. Your prompts and answers are never collected, regardless of this setting.
- **Gemini API key via the Gemini Developer API**:
  **Unpaid services**: When enabled, this setting allows Google to collect both anonymous telemetry (like commands run and performance metrics) and **your prompts and answers** for model improvement. When disabled we will use your data as described in [How Google Uses Your Data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-unpaid).
  **Paid services**: This setting only controls the collection of anonymous telemetry. Google logs prompts and responses for a limited period of time, solely for the purpose of detecting violations of the Prohibited Use Policy and any required legal or regulatory disclosures.
- **Gemini API key via the Vertex AI GenAI API:** This setting only controls the collection of anonymous telemetry. Your prompts and answers are never collected, regardless of this setting.

You can disable Usage Statistics for any account type by following the instructions in the [Usage Statistics Configuration](./cli/configuration.md#usage-statistics) documentation.
